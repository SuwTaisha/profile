            I enjoy doing lots of things, but I am just going to name a few:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h3>💻 Making random programs and learning programming languages</h3>

                    I use <b>Linux Mint</b>, and a

                    <span class="tooltip">
                        <span class="tooltip-label">custom modification</span>
                        <span class="tooltip-text">
                            I wrote code for it as well! Check out vscode-tweaks from the portal above.
                        </span>
                    </span> of <b>VSCode</b> for programming. Please do not judge me for this!!<br>
                    I do not want to force myself into intense programming work.<br><br>

                    First off, I really like making documents and webpages (like this!) using <b>HTML, CSS, and occasionally JavaScript</b>.<br>
                    I am usually expected to write code in <b>Python (upper-intermediate)</b>, because it suits the best for me.<br>
                    I am also able to write some code in <b>JavaScript</b> and <b>TypeScript</b> using <b>Node</b>.<br><br>

                    I am familiar with most basic features in Python, and I started learning some libraries for my projects.<br>
                    I can create GUI programs via <code>pygame</code>, and I usually use Python to make interactive CLIs and TUIs with dynamic output.<br><br>

                    When I was first starting programming, I started by learning JavaScript, so I know lots of rather <i>random</i> things about JavaScript.<br>
                    I don't know whether this was a good choice or not, since I did not have any goal due to me being really young.<br>
                    However, I still suck at actual web development, so I try to improve myself in web development by making
                    simple games and webpages.<br><br>

                    (I can also write good Markdown code, and a bit of LaTeX. But they're not actual programming languages, right?)
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>🌐 Studying languages, linguistics, and making conlangs</h3>

                    I want to study and experience many languages both for my conlangs and for fun.<br>

                    I can speak <b>Korean (C1)</b>, <b>English (B2 ~ C1)</b> and <b>Japanese (B1, N4 ~ N3)</b> somewhat fluently! I can have most conversations without lots of troubles.<br>
                    I'm also currently studying <b>Dutch (A2), German (A1)</b> and <b>Chinese (A2)</b>. I am really interested in studying <b>Greek</b>, though!<br><br>

                    For learning English, I used the <i>immersion method</i>™. I talked to a lot of online friends, and consumed a HECK TON of English content.<br>
                    This was really effective for me, because it was both fun and beneficial. English is one of the hardest languages to learn,<br>
                    so if you ever feel stuck, <b>you should definitely try out the immersion method!</b><br><br>

                    I started learning Japanese some-time around <b>March 2025</b> because I discovered Japanese music and anime.<br>
                    I really like talking to my friends in Japanese, as well as comparing the language with Korean.<br><br>

                    I used to be <b>somewhat decent</b> at Chinese <i>(HSK 2~3)</i> when I was younger, but <b>I forgot most of it</b> due to dismotivation.<br>
                    I blame my younger self for this, Chinese vocab is way too stressful to learn aaa
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>🔬 Studying science and its various sub-branches</h3>

                    I like most sub-branches of science, but I especially like <b>🔭 astronomy, ⚛️ physics, and 🧪 chemistry.</b><br>
                    <b>I especially love astronomy,</b> because I had interest in it ever since I was young.<br>
                    Studying science isn't in my top priorities anymore, but when someone brings up the topic, I am still
                    going to like it.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>🎮 Playing games</h3>

                    I especially like <b>idle/clicker/incremental games, rhythm games, puzzle games, space simulation games, and platformer games.</b><br>
                    However, I don't really like horror games, adventure games, resource-management heavy games and RPG games, though.<br>
                    I play games everytime I'm bored or I'm overwhelmed by everything, but lately I have been returning back to programming.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>🎧 Listening to music, and playing instruments</h3>

                    I really, <i>really</i> like Japanese music. I mostly enjoy <b>Project Sekai and vocaloid</b> songs,
                    as well as general J-pop.<br>
                    I also listen to electronic music occasionally. I always put music on when programming or working on anything.<br>
                    I like discovering random music, and occasionally looking back at Geometry Dash music.<br>
                    I can also play the drum, but I'm not really that good at it.<br>
                    I used to be able to play the piano, but I didn't find fun in playing the piano so I quit.<br>
                    I love music theory, and I want to make music someday as well.

                    <h3>🧊 Solving Rubik's cubes</h3>

                    I can speedcube somewhat decently, but I also like solving lots of different types of cubes.<br>

                    I would really like to participate in more of those fun cubing competitions!<br>
                    I don't find fun in cubing compared to what I used to before, but I used to know a lot of things about cubing.

                <li>
                    <h3>...and more!</h3>

                    I also have some other small interests and hobbies, but I'd really like to try out other things as well!
