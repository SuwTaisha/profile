        I enjoy doing lots of things, but I am just going to name a few:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <h3>🌐 Studying languages, linguistics, and making conlangs</h3>

                I want to study and experience many languages both for my conlangs and for fun.<br>

                I can speak <b>Korean</b> and

                <span class="tooltip">
                    <span class="tooltip-label">English</span>
                    <span class="tooltip-text">
                        I used the <i>immersion method</i>™ for learning English.<br>
                        I talked to a lot of online friends, and consumed a HECK TON of English content.<br>
                        I think this was really effective for me, because it was genuinely fun for me.<br>
                        English is one of the hardest languages to learn, so if you ever feel stuck,<br>
                        <b>you should definitely try out the immersion method!</b>
                    </span>
                </span> pretty fluently, and I'm able to speak some

                <span class="tooltip">
                    <span class="tooltip-label">Japanese</span>
                    <span class="tooltip-text">
                        I started learning Japanese some-time around <b>March 2025</b> due to some <i>rather specific
                            reasons</i>.<br>
                        I really like talking to my friends in Japanese, as well as comparing the language with Korean.
                    </span>
                </span> and

                <span class="tooltip">
                    <span class="tooltip-label">Chinese</span>
                    <span class="tooltip-text">
                        I used to be <b>somewhat decent</b> at Chinese <i>(HSK 2~3)</i> when I was younger,<br>
                        but <b>I forgot most of it</b> due to dismotivation.<br>
                        I blame my younger self for this, Chinese vocab is way too stressful to learn aaa
                    </span>
                </span>.<br>

                I'm also currently studying <b>Dutch and German,</b> and interested in studying <b>Greek</b>.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>💻 Making random programs and learning programming languages</h3>

                I use <b>Linux</b>, but I do not want to force myself into intense programming work.<br>
                I usually just make documents and webpages (like this!) or small utility programs using Python.<br>
                I am usually expected to write code in <b>Python</b>, because it suits the best for me.<br>
                I can create GUI programs via <code>pygame</code>, and I make interactive CLIs and TUIs with Python.<br>
                I am also able to write some code in <b>JavaScript</b> and <b>TypeScript.</b><br>
                When I was first starting programming, I started by learning JavaScript, so I know lots of, rather
                <i>random</i> things about JavaScript.<br>
                However, I still suck at actual web development, so I try to improve myself in web development by making
                simple games and webpages.<br>
                (...and there's the markup languages. I can write <b>HTML, <span
                        title="I usually just spam text-shadow and box-shadow, duh.">CSS,</span> Markdown, and some
                    LaTeX.</b> But only if you consider them actual programming languages.)<br>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>🔬 Studying science and its various sub-branches</h3>

                I like most sub-branches of science, but I especially like <b>🔭 astronomy, ⚛️ physics, and 🧪
                    chemistry.</b><br>
                <b>I especially love astronomy,</b> because I had interest in it ever since I was young.<br>
                Studying science isn't in my top priorities anymore, but when someone brings up the topic, I am still
                going to like it.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>🎮 Playing games</h3>

                I especially like <b>idle/clicker/incremental games, rhythm games, puzzle games, space simulation games,
                    and platformer games.</b><br>
                However, I don't really like horror games, adventure games, resource-management heavy games and RPG
                games, though.<br>
                I play games everytime I'm bored or I'm overwhelmed by everything, but lately I have been returning back
                to programming.<br>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>🎧 Listening to music, and playing instruments</h3>

                <span title="I really, REALLY hate Korean music.">I really, <i>really</i> like Japanese music.</span> I
                mostly enjoy <span title="HELLO!! I'M EMU OTORI! EMU IS MEANING... SMILE!!!!!!!!"><b>Project
                        Sekai</b></span> songs and <b>vocaloid</b> songs, as well as general J-pop.<br>
                I also listen to electronic music occasionally. I always put music on when programming or working on
                anything.<br>
                I like discovering random music, and occasionally looking back at Geometry Dash music. <span
                    title="Yes. Everything is nostalgia for me.">(brings me a lot of nostalgia)</span><br>
                I can also play the drum, but I'm not really that good at it.<br>
                I used to be able to play the piano, but I didn't find fun in playing the piano so I quit.<br>
                I love music theory, and I want to make music someday as well.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>...and more!</h3>

                I also have some other small interests, such as

                <span class="tooltip">
                    <span class="tooltip-label">solving Rubik's cubes</span>
                    <span class="tooltip-text">
                        I can speedcube somewhat decently, but I also like solving lots of different types of cubes.<br>
                        My PB / PR on the 3x3 cube is <b>14.6 seconds</b>.<br>
                        I don't find fun in cubing compared to what I used to before,<br>
                        but I used to know a lot of things about cubing.
                    </span>
                </span>, and <span title="Why did I put this? I suck at drawing anime."><b>drawing anime.</b></span> But
                I'd really like to try out other things as well!
            </li>
