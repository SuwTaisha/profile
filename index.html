        <p>
            <b>Hello there!</b> 👋<br>

            I go by the name of <b>Lanzoor</b>, but you can also call me <b>Lanzy</b>! My Japanese name is
            <ruby>

                <rt>らんそうる</rt><rp>)</rp>
            </ruby> but you can still call me ランジョア.<br>
            My pronouns are <b>he/him</b>, and I live in <b>South Korea</b> 🇰🇷! (UTC+9, it is <code id="time_text">HH:MM:SS</code> here!)<br>
            I joined Discord on <b>October 7th, 2023</b>, and I am usually active on Discord most of the time. My birthday is <b>November 2nd</b> 🎂<br>
            My MBTI is <span class="tooltip"><b>INTP</b><span class="tooltip-text">
        I - Introverted<br>
        N - Overthinks<br>

    </span>
</span>! <span title="Not this text, though!">(hover for more information)</span> However, due to some <span title="If you want, navigate to profiles/private."><i>personal reasons</i></span>, <span title="Definitely not a
命に嫌われている reference...">life decided to hate on me</span>, and I have developed ADHD, OCD and social anxiety.<br>
            I enjoy doing lots of things, but I am just going to name a few:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                🌐 <b>Studying languages, linguistics, and making conlangs</b><br>
                I want to study and experience many languages both for my conlangs and for fun.<br>
                I can speak <b>Korean</b> and <b>English</b> pretty fluently, and can speak some <b>Japanese</b> and <b>Chinese.</b><br>
                I'm also currently studying <b>Dutch,</b> and interested in studying <span title="Greek has the best writing system imo. However, math decided to ruin it for me, and..."><b>Greek</b></span> and <b>German.</b>
            </li>
            <li>
                💻 <b>Making random programs and learning programming languages</b><br>
                I use <span title="(I use Linux Mint btw, please don't judge me)"><b>Linux</b></span>, but I do not want to force myself into intense programming work.<br>
                I usually just make documents and webpages (like this!) or small utility programs using Python.<br>
                I am usually expected to write code in <b>Python</b>, because it suits the best for me.<br>
                I can also create GUI programs via <code>pygame</code>, but I used to make interactive CLIs and TUIs with Python.<br>
                I am also able to write some code in <b>JavaScript</b> and <b>TypeScript.</b><br>
                When I was first starting programming, <span title="Don't ask me why, I don't remember why either.">I started by learning JavaScript,</span> so I know lots of, rather <i>random</i> things about JavaScript.<br>
                However, I still suck at actual web development, so I try to improve myself in web development by making simple games.<br>
                (...and there's the markup languages. I can write <b>HTML, <span title="I usually just spam text-shadow and box-shadow, duh.">CSS,</span> Markdown, and some LaTeX.</b> But only if you consider them actual programming languages.)<br>
            </li>
            <li>
                🔬 <b>Studying science and its various sub-branches</b><br>
                I like most sub-branches of science, and especially <b>🧪 chemistry, 🔭 astronomy, and ⚛️ physics.</b><br>
                <b>I especially love astronomy,</b> because I had interest in it ever since I was young.<br>
                Studying science isn't in my top priorities anymore, but when someone brings up the topic, I am still going to like it.
            </li>
            <li>
                🎮 <b>Playing games</b><br>
                I especially like <b>idle/clicker/incremental games, rhythm games, puzzle games, space simulation games, and platformer games.</b><br>
                I don't really like horror games, adventure games, resource-management heavy games and RPG games, though.<br>
                I play games everytime I'm bored or I'm overwhelmed by everything, but lately I have been returning back to programming.<br>
            </li>
            <li>
                🎧 <b>Listening to music, and playing instruments.</b><br>
                <span title="I really, REALLY hate Korean music.">I really, <i>really</i> like Japanese music.</span> I mostly enjoy <span title="HELLO!! I'M EMU OTORI! EMU IS MEANING... SMILE!!!!!!!!">PJSK</span> songs and vocaloid songs, but I sometimes listen to general J-Pop.<br>
                I also listen to some electronic music but only occasionally. I always put music on when programming or working on anything.<br>
                I like discovering random music, and occasionally looking back at Geometry Dash music. <span title="Yes. Everything is nostalgia for me.">(brings me a lot of nostalgia)</span><br>
                I can also play the drum, but I'm not really that good at it.
            </li>
            <li>
                I also have some other small interests, such as solving Rubik's cubes, and drawing anime. But I'd really like to try out other things as well!
            </li>
        </ul>
