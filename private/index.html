                It's difficult for me to say this publicly, but I think context matters for understanding who I am now.<br><br>

                Over the past years, I went through prolonged medical treatment for cancer (osteosarcoma), which forced me into both social and psychological isolation during a critical stage of my development. During that time, I had very limited opportunities to learn how to socialize naturally, and I later developed ADHD, OCD, social anxiety, and related difficulties.<br><br>

                I entered online spaces without having the experience or tools to navigate relationships properly. I often didn't understand boundaries, expectations, or how my behavior might be perceived. As a result, I made mistakes and decisions that I really regret. If my younger self affected anyone negatively, I want it to be clear that <b>those actions never reflected my true intentions or values.</b> They came from confusion and inexperience, not malice.<br><br>

                After a specific turning point, I made a deliberate effort to reflect, change, and take responsibility for my behavior. That process has been ongoing, and I continue to work on myself.<br><br>

                Even after making changes, and every point has been cleared, I've repeatedly experienced situations where new connections faded without explanation, or where I felt ignored or misunderstood by people I genuinely cared about. Those experiences left a lasting impact, and they have influenced how I approach relationships today. I had to change my texting style countless times due to this, and kept thinking that I wasn't empathetic enough. I even tried to change my personality. I can become anxious, overthink interactions, or withdraw unintentionally when I feel uncertain.<br><br>

                Due to these experiences, I struggle with periods of intense mental overload. When that happens, my thoughts become scattered or shut down entirely, and things that once mattered to me can feel distant, boring, or impossible to engage with. During my lowest moments, this has included passive thoughts about not wanting to exist or questioning whether continuing is worth it. I am actively working through this and seeking healthier ways to live.<br><br>

                I'm not sharing this to ask for sympathy, forgiveness, or special treatment. I'm sharing it because this history shapes how I communicate and react, even when I'm trying my best. I value honesty, empathy, and growth, and I continue to work toward being better aligned with those values.<br><br>

                <b>Thank you for trying to understand the difficulties.</b> ♡
